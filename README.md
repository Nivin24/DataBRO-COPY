## 💡 The Idea Behind This App

> "As a data science student, I love to help my like-minded people."

That’s the heart of this project.

I've built this app with the goal to:
- Remove confusion for beginners about where to start.
- Provide **only the most useful** theory, resources, and practicals.
- Make learning **interactive and effective** with quizzes, flashcards, and real tools.
- Create a **complete roadmap** so no learner wastes their time figuring out what to study next.
